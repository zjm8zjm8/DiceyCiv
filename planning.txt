- Research: Numismatics (unlocks trade) (Needs straight)
- Research: Logisitcs (unlocks scout outpost) (Needs triple)
- Research: Smithing (unlocks preemptive strike) (Needs pair of fives)
- When numismatics is researched, you can receive trade requests and gold is unlocked as a resource.
- Numismatics also grants a new spell "Bless" (Needs 3), which grants an extra die on the next turn.
- Scout outpost: Needs 40 food, 10 wood, 5 stone
	-Built outpost gives warnings when the Deephors are at 25% (12), 50% (22), and 80% (36) aggression.
	-"Deephors are holding drills."
	-"Deephors are stockpiling weapons."
	-"Deephors are gathering for war."
	-"Deephors attack! You have lost xyz..."
- Preemptive strike unlocks "Pacify Deephors" (Min 5)
	- Also unlocks button "Build more weaponry" (24 wood, 12 stone, 8 copper)
		-That unlocks "Pacify Deephors+" (Min 3)
		-Next button is "Build better armor" (8 wood, 8 stone, 10 copper)
			-Unlocks "Pacify Deephors++" (Min 1)
	- Preemptive strike also reduces Deephor population by 1, to a minimum of 1.
	- Preemptive strike grants honor when used.
- Final goal is to build shrine, which takes honor and gold in addition to copper, iron, wood, and stone.

Trade:

50 food = 30 wood = 20 stone = 10 copper = 5 iron = 1 gold

Deephors keep 10% as tariff

1 Gold = 45 food = 27 wood = 18 stone = 9 copper = 4 iron

War:

Deephors roll dice and play a hidden game alongside the player. 
Each day, they roll a die and get some bonus.
Day 1: Food
 - Deephors roll 1d4. If they get a 4, they grow.
 - If they get a 2 or 3, they do not grow.
 - If they get a 1, they shrink.
 - Population in this section is X.
Day 2: Resources

	-7, Gold for Stone will be the next trade.
	-8, Gold for Copper/Iron will be the next trade.
Day 3: War
 - Deephors roll Xd4. The total is added to the war total.
 - Once the war total reaches 45 (EV of 24 days or 6 Deephorian weeks) they attack.
 - Total can be revealed by scouting, reduced by preemptive strike.
 - An attack will select a random resource and drain it to 25% full.
Day 4: Trade
 - Deephors roll Xd4. The total is added to the trade total.
 - The sum is added to the trade price and then 10 is subtracted.
